e\-Solid -\/ Memory Management is a bare-\/memory manager for embedded devices.

e\-Solid is a collection of resources for embedded system design and this Memory management is only a piece of that collection.

\subsection*{Using e\-Solid -\/ Memory management}

\subsubsection*{Configuration and ports}

Configuration is done in two files\-: {\ttfamily \hyperlink{mem__cfg_8h}{mem\-\_\-cfg.\-h}} (port independent settings) and in {\ttfamily cpu\-\_\-cfg.\-h} (port depended settings, located in port structure). Currently, memory management is ported only to A\-R\-Mv7-\/\-M architecture range of microcontrollers. It was tested on S\-T\-M32\-F100 series of microcontrollers, but it should work, with minimal modifications, on any A\-R\-Mv7-\/\-M C\-P\-U. Some other ports like A\-V\-R-\/\-G\-C\-C are planned, too.

\subsubsection*{Building}

The kernel was built using arm-\/none-\/eabi G\-C\-C v4.\-7.\-3 compiler toolchain (from \href{https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download}{\tt https\-://launchpad.\-net/gcc-\/arm-\/embedded/+download}) and binary was downloaded to the M\-C\-U using {\itshape texane} gdb-\/server. There are no makefiles, it is assumed that I\-D\-E will generate them for you.

\subparagraph*{Example for S\-T\-M32\-F10x family port}

There are two groups of source files which need to be compiled for A\-R\-Mv7-\/\-M architecture\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{mem_8c}{mem.\-c} in {\ttfamily ./src} source directory and
\item cpu.\-c in {\ttfamily ./port/arm-\/none-\/eabi-\/gcc/v7-\/m} port directory.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The following include paths are needed\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily ./inc}
\item {\ttfamily ./port/arm-\/none-\/eabi-\/gcc/common}
\item {\ttfamily ./port/arm-\/none-\/eabi-\/gcc/v7-\/m}
\item {\ttfamily ./port/arm-\/none-\/eabi-\/gcc/stm32f10x}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Documentation}

Some documentation is available under Wiki \href{https://github.com/nradulovic/esolid-mem/wiki}{\tt https\-://github.\-com/nradulovic/esolid-\/mem/wiki}. Doxygen configuration and full documentation source files are available in {\ttfamily /doc} directory. Go to the directory {\ttfamily doc} create a directory named {\ttfamily kernel} and than run doxygen\-: \begin{DoxyVerb}# doxygen doxyfile-mem
# doxygen doxyfile-mem-port
\end{DoxyVerb}


This will generate H\-T\-M\-L, La\-Tex and man documentation in {\ttfamily ./doc/mem} and {\ttfamily ./doc/mem-\/port} directories, respectively.

\subsubsection*{Running}

To successfully use and run kernel you will need to study the memory management documentation. The documentation is still being written and some examples will be added later.
